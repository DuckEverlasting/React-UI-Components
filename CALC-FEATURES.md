Calculator is now working! Here are some features:

- Adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides correctly. (Negative numbers can be calculated, but cannot yet be entered by the user.)
- Clear button resets the calculator.
- Responds correctly to 10 character limit. Rounds, prevents additional characters from being added, or displays error screen as necessary.
- Operator buttons turn darker when they are "active"
- Allows chaining of operations without first pressing equals button (e.g. user can input "4 + 3 / 2 * 5")
- Equals button deselects "active" operator if no additional value has been added first.
- Calculator will not let user add additional '0's to the number 0.
